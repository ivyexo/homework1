    <p>
      Byun Baek-hyun (Korean: 변백현; born May 6, 1992), better known
      mononymously as Baekhyun, is a South Korean singer, songwriter and actor.
      Baekhyun began training under SM Entertainment in 2011. A few months
      later, he made his debut in 2012 as a member of the South Korean-Chinese
      boy group Exo, its sub-group Exo-K and later on its sub-unit Exo-CBX. He
      is also the leader of South Korean supergroup SuperM. Following the
      release of several albums and extended plays with Exo, Baekhyun began
      pursuing a solo career in 2019 by releasing his debut extended play, City
      Lights, which sold more than half-a-million copies in 2019 and is the
      best-selling album by a solo artist of the 2010s in South Korea.[2] City
      Lights was followed by two million-selling EPs, Delight (2020), the first
      album by a solo artist in South Korea to have sold over 1 million copies
      in 19 years, and Bambi (2021).[3][4] He has been labeled as the "Genius
      Idol",[5] and won three consecutive Mnet Asian Music Awards for Best Male
      Artist from 2019 to 2021.
